**TITLE**

Context
A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a credit derivative contract between two counterparties. The buyer makes periodic payments to the seller, and in 
return receives a payoff if an underlying financial instrument defaults or experiences a similar credit event. The CDS may refer to a specified loan or 
bond obligation of a "reference entity", usually a corporation or government. The spread of a CDS is the annual amount the protection buyer must pay 
the protection seller over the length of the contract, expressed as a percentage of the notional amount. All things being equal, at any given time, if the maturity 
of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a higher CDS spread is considered more likely to default by the market, since a higher 
fee is being charged to protect against this happening.
